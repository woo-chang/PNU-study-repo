    <h1>Welcome to Our Website!</h1>

    <p>We have designed this site to teach about the wonders of
        <strong><em>HTML5</em></strong>. <em>HTML5</em> is better equipped than <em>HTML</em> to represent complex data
        on the Internet. <em>HTML5</em> takes advantage of XML's strict syntax to ensure well-formedness. Soon you will
        know about many of the great features of <em>HTML5.</em>
